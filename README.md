# Digital Logic Circuit - Screening Task

This project contains my solution to the digital logic circuit screening task.

## 🧠 Logic Design

### Inputs:
- A, B, and C (Binary values: 1 or 0)

### Logic Used:
1. Input A and B are given to an AND gate.
2. Input C is given to a NOT gate.
3. Outputs from AND and NOT gates are fed into an OR gate.
4. The final output is observed from the OR gate.

### Truth Table (Sample):
| A | B | C | AND | NOT(C) | OR Output |
|---|---|---|-----|--------|-----------|
| 1 | 1 | 0 |  1  |   1    |     1     |
